# What is the project?
*     Building a **Fault-Tolerant Key-Value Store**.
*     The main functionalities of the Key-Value Store :
      * **CRUD operations :** A key-value store supporting CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
      * **Load-balancing :** via a consistent hashing ring to hash both servers and keys.
      * **Fault-tolerance up to two failures :** by replicating each key three times to three successive nodes in the ring, starting from the first node at or to the clockwise of the hashed key.
      * **Quorum consistency level** for both reads and writes (at least two replicas).
      * **Stabilization :** after failure (recreate three replicas after failure).

# How do I run the Grader on my computer ?
*	There is a grader script KVStoreGrader.sh. The tests include:
      * **Basic CRUD** tests that test if three replicas respond
      * **Single failure** followed immediately by operations which should succeed (as quorum can still be
reached with 1 failure)
      * **Multiple failures** followed immediately by operations which should fail as quorum cannot be
reached
      * Failures followed by a time for the system to re-stabilize, followed by operations that should
succeed because the key has been re-replicated again at three nodes.
```
	$ chmod +x KVStoreGrader.sh
	$ ./KVStoreGrader.sh
```
# Result
*	Points achieved: 90 out of 90 [100%]
